              <h2>Intention and Warning</h2>
              <p>The intention to create this website is to provide a simple, easy and quick way to edit a sample letter or write your own on the browser and print it with ease, without the need to open a text editor or login to an online service etc. Basically a 'point-and-shoot' text editor. </p>

              <p>Again, the information and services provided here DOES NOT substitute for professional advice. You are using these FREE services of this website at your own risk.</p>

              <h2>Behind the Scene</h2>
              <p>I started and built the site with the amazing <a href="http://rubyonrails.org"> Ruby on Rails</a> framework. Eventhough the current site does not use much of what Rails offer, however as the Tibetan saying goes,<strong><em>"build the dam before the flood comes",</em> </strong>the decision to use rails was made to facilitate any dynamic feature we may need in the future. </p>

              <p>The text editor is based on <a href="https://github.com/daviferreira">David Ferreira's</a> clone of the beautiful inline editor toolbar <a href="https://medium.com">medium editor</a> and  was written in vanilla Javascript.</p>

              <p>The front-end framework is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter's bootstrap.</a> This website lives in <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, runs from <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> and was made with love by Thupten N. Chakrishar.
