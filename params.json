Eventhough the current site does not use much of what Rails offer, however as the Tibetan saying goes,<strong><em>\"build the dam before the flood comes\",</em> </strong>the decision to use rails was made to facilitate any dynamic feature we may need in the future. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The text editor is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/daviferreira\">David Ferreira's</a> clone of the beautiful inline editor toolbar <a href=\"https://medium.com\">medium editor</a> and  was written in vanilla Javascript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The front-end framework is <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">Twitter's bootstrap.</a> This website lives in <a href=\"http://github.com\">Github</a>, runs from <a href=\"http://heroku.com\">Heroku</a> and was made with love by Thupten N.
