           <p>To Whom it May Concern:</p>

<p>Please be informed that Sonam Wangdu and Karma Dolma have been tenants of my apartment, 1234 Ithaca Street, Elmhurst, NY 11373 since October 21, 2009. During that time they have been good tenants in that they always kept their apartment neat and clean, were considerate of their neighbors and paid their rent on time. We anticipate full refund of their security deposit.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
