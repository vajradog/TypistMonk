<p>AFFIDAVIT OF NYIMA PHENTOK</p>

<p>I, Nyima Phentok, pursuant to 28 USC &sect; 1746, declare that the following is true and correct:</p>

<p>
My name is Nyima Phentok. I am the Vice President ___________, headquartered at 111 West 1 St., New York, NY 10000.</p>

<p>I am a United States Citizen. I was naturalized in November 2001. My alien number is: A XX-XXX-XXXX</p>

<p>___________ is a nonprofit, international organization with 5 offices across the world. </p>

<p>I have known Dicky Yangzom in my capacity as the Vice President of _________. She is a respected member of _______ in Chinese Occupied Tibet. She was a bold and courageous organizer and coordinator within the youth movement for Tibetan freedom. </p>

<p>Chinese government often suppresses the voice of Tibetan activists. Many young Tibetans living in Tibet have gone to jail and suffered police beatings because of their participation in nonviolent demonstrations. </p>

<p>Ms. Yangzom, who has helped organize these demonstrations, is known to Chinese authorities and is in danger of being arrested and jailed for her participation if she returns to China. </p>
